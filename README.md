#### Some of the general information that the mirror will provide are

- Personalized calendar events for today

- Personalized news feed items (news), text messages and social feed items (notifications)

- Clock and local weather


#### The mirror should also provide health-related information such as

- How long you slept last night, and how your total hours sleep compares to the last week of data

- Your current weight (assuming you have a scale embedded in the floor in front of the mirror), and how it compares to the last week of data

- How many steps you took, how long you stood, and how long you exercised yesterday, and how that compares to the last week of data on a time series plot

- How long do you spend in front of the mirror


#### Some other things the system should do

- Allow the user to customize the display - e.g. the widget locations (drag and drop items in the desired location on the screen)

- Play music when you are brushing your teeth or in the shower (Select what you want to play on your phone)

- Act as a light source (with different possible colors)

- Your imagination (Stocks)
