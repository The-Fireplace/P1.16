**Some of the general information that the mirror will provide are**
- personalized calendar events for today
- personalized news feed items (news), text messages and social feed items (notifications)
- clock and local weather

**The mirror should also provide health-related information such as**
- how long you slept last night, and how your total hours sleep compares to the last week of data
- your current weight (assuming you have a scale embedded in the floor in front of the mirror), and how it compares to the last week of data
- how many steps you took, how long you stood, and how long you exercised yesterday, and how that compares to the last week of data on a time series plot.
- how long do you spend in front of the mirror

**Some other things the system should do**
- allow the user to customize the display - e.g. the widget locations (drag and drop items in the desired location on the screen)
- play music when you are brushing your teeth or in the shower (Select what you want to play on your phone)
- act as a light source (with different possible colors)
- your imagination (Stocks)
